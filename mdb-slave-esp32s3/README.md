# MDB Cashless Device Implementation on ESP32
This project aims to implement an MDB (Multi-Drop Bus) cashless device using an ESP32 microcontroller. The goal is to enable the ESP32 to interface with vending machines and other devices that support the MDB protocol, allowing for cashless transactions using modern payment methods such as mobile payments, contactless cards, or online accounts.
